# Kelvin Mang's Portfolio Website

This is a personal portfolio website built using React. It showcases my skills, work experience, and projects. The website includes a header, about me, skills, work experience, projects, and contact me sections. Visitors can send messages to me using the contact form, and the website features hover effects for better user experience.
